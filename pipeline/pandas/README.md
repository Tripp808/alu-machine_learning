# Bitcoin Price Analysis

This project focuses on learning and applying pandas for data analysis using historical Bitcoin price data from Coinbase (Dec 2014 - Jan 2019). It includes scripts for calculating descriptive statistics (`13-analyze.py`) and visualizing daily price trends (`14-visualize.py`). The analysis excludes the `Weighted_Price` column and addresses missing values appropriately. Requirements: `pandas` and `matplotlib`. To run, use `python3 13-analyze.py` for statistics and `python3 14-visualize.py` for visualizations.
