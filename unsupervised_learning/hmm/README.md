Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a type of probabilistic model used to represent systems that transition between hidden states over time. They are particularly useful for modeling sequential data, where the observed outputs depend on an underlying, unobservable state. HMMs consist of **states**, **transition probabilities**, **emission probabilities**, and an **initial state distribution**. The **Viterbi algorithm** is commonly used for decoding the most likely sequence of hidden states, while the **Baum-Welch algorithm** helps in training HMMs. Applications of HMMs include speech recognition, biological sequence analysis, financial modeling, and handwriting recognition.
