Hyperparameter tuning is the process of optimizing the parameters that control the learning process of a machine learning model to improve its performance. Unlike model parameters, which are learned from data, hyperparameters are set before training and influence aspects such as learning rate, regularization strength, and the number of hidden layers in a neural network. Common techniques for hyperparameter tuning include **grid search**, **random search**, and more advanced methods like **Bayesian optimization** and **genetic algorithms**. Proper tuning helps prevent overfitting or underfitting, leading to better generalization and improved model accuracy.
