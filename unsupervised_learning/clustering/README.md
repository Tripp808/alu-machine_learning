Clustering in unsupervised learning is a technique used to group similar data points together without predefined labels. It identifies patterns and structures within a dataset by organizing data into clusters based on similarities or distances between points. Common clustering algorithms include K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, each suited for different data distributions and applications. Clustering is widely used in market segmentation, anomaly detection, image recognition, and recommendation systems, helping to uncover hidden patterns and insights in large datasets.
